# DataCollectionDemo
This is a sample implementation of collecting RSSI value and inertial data on Android platform.   

**Some notes:**   
1. The program will crush when you click the collection bution without filling out the 
appropriate cooridinates. So you need to check the integrity of information inputted by user.
2. when you collect RSSI data on the devices running on Android 9 or higher, don't forget
open WiFi scan throttling.
