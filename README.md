# DataCollectionDemo
This is a sample implementation of collecting RSSI value and inertial data in Android.   

**Some notes:**   
1. The program will crush when you click the collection bution without filling out the 
appropriate cooridinates. 
2. when you collect RSSI data on the devices running on Android 9 or higher, don't forget
open WiFi scan throttling.    

Also, there are many unfixed bugs in this Android application as it is just a simple demonstration. You should modify the program to meet your own requirement.
